I find the data in Observability fascinating. In every aspect of an SRE I see
problems to solve with data rather than brute force. In fact, all of us in the
Observability space are really Data Engineers and Data Scientists in disguise.
The only way to fully understand our complex systems is through math and
visualizations. Let's explore the 4 Golden Signals and the math behind why they
work well and some tricks to bridging Observability and Business Intelligence.

In this talk I'll cover each of the 4 Golden Signals and speak to the data
engineering tools used for each to give folks a broad platform to discover new
math and new techniques for solving their own data problems:

1) Traffic: Counters and Calculus -- The Physics Behind why Counters Work.

2) Errors: Counting vs Sampling and the Nyquest-Shannon Theory. Your CPU
metrics are wrong and I can prove it.

3) Latency: Timers and Distributions -- Why averages are horrible and
Anscombe's Quartet. Understanding Gamma Distributions.

4) Saturation: Percentiles and Pipelines -- Visualizing percentiles of data,
why we cannot combine percentiles, and the magic of histograms.

Finally, all of us in Observability have been asked at some point to
participate in managing the data behind Business Intelligence. Data about the
product likely comes from the product itself directly through its telemetry.
Often the requirements are high cardinality and high in volume making it
difficult to store raw data for months on end to produce accurate BI. We'll
work around the limits of percentiles and show some tricks for extracting
events, storing those as summary data, and producing monthly percentile based
reports with T-Digests.
